Dynamic server
==============

If http:// is left off of a home page in a comment, add it.

Registration and user settings editor.
  Mostly done.
  Need to do user moderation page, so I can remove users who turn out to be
    spammers.
  May eventually need to moderate new users.

Maximum length for node aliases (site files names).

Categories page, linked from the category name on each post, containing the last 10 posts in each category. Add to RSS feed.

"Hold" column ("H") on Comments Moderation page. Let users moderate their own
unpublished comments.

Twitter integration: account & post

[quote person]
ctrl-shift-Q javascript to enter blockquote

Close <a> tags, to prevent the whole rest of the page from being caught.
  These won't get through comment moderation, so no biggy for now

Plug-in architecture, including adding new formats (text -> html)

Re-render subsets of the site or whole site.
Dynamic serving. Is it faster? Is it faster if I preload the data?
